# Principal-Component-Analysis-with-NumPy

In this project, you will do all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery of the various learning algorithms yourself, so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals. By the time you complete this project, you will be able to implement and apply PCA from scratch using NumPy in Python, conduct basic exploratory data analysis, and create simple data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### In this Project, you will:

- Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch with NumPy and Python

- Conduct basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Create simple data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

---

### Following steps are performed:

- Introduction and Overview

- Load the Data and Libraries

- Visualize the Data

- Data Standardization

- Compute the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

- Selecting Principal Components Using the Explained Variance

- Project Data Onto a Lower-Dimensional Linear Subspace.
